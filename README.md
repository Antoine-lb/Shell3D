# Shell3D
Small implementation of a [Ray Casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) renderer in ASCII.

Highly inspired of Lode Vandevenne [blog post](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) on Ray Casting.

This is a fork of my project for [42 School](https://42.fr).

Only tested on MacOS.
